Git Basic Exercise

1.- Create a folder called learn_git_again.
to create the requested folder you would type  'mkdir learn_git_again'


2.- cd into the learn_git_again folder.
to change directory to that folder we type 
cd learn_git_again


3.- Create a file called third.txt.
Creating a new file with that name would be with 
touch third.txt


4.- Initialize an empty git repository.
to initialize we would type
git init


5.- Add third.txt to the staging area.
we would type
git add third.txt 


6.- Commit with the message “adding third.txt”.
git commit -m "adding third.txt" 
This would create a new commit in the git repo with the message addingg third.txt


7.- Check out your commit with git log.
git log


8.- Create another file called fourth.txt.
we would use touch like in exersize 3. 'touch fourth.txt'

git add fourth.txt


10.- Commit with the message “adding fourth.txt”
git commit -m "adding fourth.txt"


11.- Remove the third.txt file
rm third.txt
